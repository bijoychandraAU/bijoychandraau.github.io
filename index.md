**Bijoychandra S. Takhellambam** is working as a Post-Doctoral Research Assistant at [Purdue University](https://ag.purdue.edu/PI2/tbijoych). He completed his Ph.D. in Biosystem Engineering (minor in statistics) from [Auburn University](https://www.eng.auburn.edu/bsen/). He holds a Master's in Hydrology from [Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, India](https://hy.iitr.ac.in/). His work focuses on climate impacts on water resources, including rainfall erosivity, hydroclimatic extremes, and hydrological modeling. Past research includes *developing Best Practice Management (BMPs) using [soil erosion model](https://www.fs.usda.gov/ccrc/tool/watershed-erosion-prediction-project-wepp) for a small-hilly watershed*, *Cost-effective combination of T-head groynes for river bank protection*, and *hydraulic modeling using 1-D [Hydrologic Engineering Center's (CEIWR-HEC) River Analysis System (HEC-RAS)](https://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-ras/) for flood discharge estimation using at-site stage information*. He is currently working on **sub-surface tile drainage intergration to [Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC)](https://vic.readthedocs.io/en/master/Overview/ModelOverview/) model for sustainable water and nutrient mangements**. His Google Scholar page may be found [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I6bZieUAAAAJ&hl=en). You may reach him at tbijoych@purdue.edu. 

He likes activities and sports in his spare time, including soccer, cricket, table tennis, volleyball, and hiking.
