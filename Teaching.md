    <p><strong> 1. Soil Physics</strong><br>
  The goal of this course is to use the R language to introduce students to data science. Additionally, it will introduce students to the concepts of reproducible research, result sharing, version control (using GitHub), and data management and modification. By the end of the course, learners need to be able to generate dynamic reports and interactive web applications for data visualization and analysis. Additionally, students ought to be able to create their own R packages, publish them on GitHub, and use literate programming to document them.


This course focus on Fundamentals of soil physics; transport of chemicals, heat, and gases; field spatial
variability; principles and methods of physical analysis of soils; the influence of soil physical processes
on environmental quality and agricultural production.

The learning objectives:
•  To understand basic physical processes that occur in soils, including water, chemical, and heat
transport.
• To be able to calculate key soil physical property values and soil physical process rates, when
given appropriate input data.
• To develop knowledge and skills in the principles and methodology for assessing soil physical
properties and processes.
• To understand and describe the principles of soil structure formation and soil health
improvement and assessment.
• To understand the effects of soil physical properties and processes on crop production and
environmental quality</p>

    <p><strong>1. Environmental Field Skills</strong><br>
  This practical laboratory course seeks to provide students with firsthand experience with environmental monitoring field methodologies, using real-world events as a basis. These include of measuring stream discharge, carrying out slug tests, gathering aquatic sample data, carrying out surveys, and drawing wetlands boundaries. Using surrounding areas and watersheds as our classroom, this course aims to give students real-world experience.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Senior Capstone Design</strong><br>
    Through small group projects, students apply the multidisciplinary insights they have learned in class to investigate current environmental issues. Activities for service-learning are included in these projects, which are designed to fit into the semester. Depending on the interests of the students, topics can range from urban gardening to stormwater management. This capstone project connects academia with practical environmental practices by providing chances for professional growth, networking, and hands-on learning.</p>
