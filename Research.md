    <p><strong>Model Development of Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC)</strong><br>
    Drainage or tile drainage for sub-surface is essential for water and nutrient management in high-water table areas. The major concern of hypoxia in Missippi is due to the uncontrol discahrge of nutrients from the field and watershed areas. This study focus on integrating the tile drainage to the VIC model for management and decision making for water and nutrients.</p>

    <p><strong>Climate Change Implications on Rainfall and its Characteristics</strong><br>
    The study developed high-temporal resolution precipitation data using in-situ and NetCDF datasets, and created <a href="https://github.com/bijoychandraAU/PrecipTDS">PrecipTDS</a>, an R-package for generating future 15-minute rainfall projections from various climate models. It quantified mid-century rainfall erosivity under climate change in the Southeast United States and developed artificial neural network-powered rainfall intensity-duration-frequency curves for future climate scenarios. Additionally, the study quantified uncertainty in these curves using bootstrapping resampling techniques.</p>

    <p><strong>Assessing Runoff, Soil Erosion, and Erosion Potential in Hilly Watersheds: Field and Simulation Studies on different Farming Systems under changing climate</strong><br>
    In this study, best practice management was developed under changing climate. A processed based soil erosion model was used to simulate different farming system. </p>

    <p><strong> Hydraulic Modeling for River Discharge</strong><br>
    This reseaerch conducted through analysis using the HEC-RAS hydraulic model to evaluate 1-D unsteady flow, focusing on two prominent rivers: Chattahoochee and Godavari. Collected and analyzed daily weather station data alongside meticulously measured river cross-sections and flow discharge. Resulted in the development of a comprehensive HEC-RAS model, contributing to a deeper understanding of hydraulic dynamics and water resource management. </p>
